Release process
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure you have `hub` installed.

```
brew install hub
```

Releasing
---------

To release new versions of ThriftRW Go, follow these instructions.

1.  Set up some environment variables for use later.

        # The version being released.
        VERSION=1.2.3

        # This is the branch from which $VERSION will be released.
        # This is almost always dev.
        BRANCH=dev

2.  Set up a release branch. We will propose the release from this branch.

        git fetch origin master
        git checkout -b $(whoami)/release origin/master

3.  Merge changes to be released into this branch.

        git merge $BRANCH

4.  Verify that there are no changes to the generated code.

        make generate
        git diff

    If the diff is non-empty, abort the release and figure out why the
    generated code has changed.

5.  Alter the Unreleased entry in CHANGELOG.md to point to `$VERSION` and
    update the link at the bottom of the file. Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for
    the year.

    ```diff
    -## [Unreleased]
    +## [1.2.3] - 2020-01-03
    ```

    ```diff
    -[Unreleased]: https://github.com/thriftrw/thriftrw-go/compare/v1.2.2...HEAD
    +[1.2.3]: https://github.com/thriftrw/thriftrw-go/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3
    ```

6.  Update the version number in version/version.go and verify that it matches
    what is in the changelog.

        sed -i '' -e "s/^const Version =.*/const Version = \"$VERSION\"/" version/version.go
        make verifyversion

7.  Create a commit for the release.

        git add version/version.go CHANGELOG.md
        git commit -m "Preparing release v$VERSION"

8.  Make a pull request with these changes against `master`.

        hub pull-request -b master --push

9.  Land the pull request after approval as a **merge commit**. To do this,
    select **Create a merge commit** from the pull-down next to the merge
    button and click **Merge pull request**.

    Please update the subject to be the release. For example, v1.2.3 (#PR).
    The body of the merge commit should be a short description of the
    changes to be merged into master.

    Please note that the pull request title and comment are NOT the contents
    of the merge commit subject and body. The merge commit message is set
    in the form that appears after you click **Merge pull request** and before
    you confirm the merge.

    Make sure you delete that branch after it has been merged with
    **Delete Branch**.

10. Once the change has been landed, pull it locally.

        git checkout master
        git pull

11. Tag a release.

        hub release create -o -m v$VERSION -t master v$VERSION

12. Copy the changelog entries for this release into the release description
    in the newly opened browser window.

13. Switch back to development.

        git checkout $BRANCH
        git merge master
        git checkout -b back-to-dev

14. Add a placeholder for the next version to CHANGELOG.md and a new link at
    the bottom.

    ```diff
    +## [Unreleased]
    +- No changes yet.
    +
     ## [1.2.3] - 2020-01-03
    ```

    ```diff
    +[Unreleased]: https://github.com/thriftrw/thriftrw-go/compare/v1.2.3...HEAD
     [1.2.3]: https://github.com/thriftrw/thriftrw-go/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3
    ```

15. Update the version number in version/version.go to the next minor version.

    ```diff
    -const Version = "1.2.3"
    +const Version = "1.3.0"
    ```

16. Verify the version number matches.

        make verifyversion

17. Update the generated code.

        make generate

18. Open a PR with your changes against `dev` to back to development.

        git commit -am "Back to development"
        hub pull-request -b dev --push

19. Merge this pull request once approved as a merge commit.

    Please update the subject of the the merge commit as 'Back to
    development (#PR)', message body contents are not required.

    Please note that the pull request title and comment are NOT the contents
    of the merge commit subject and body. The merge commit message is set
    in the form that appears after you click **Merge pull request** and before
    you confirm the merge.
